DIGITAL THERMOMETER USING 8051 MICROCONTROLLER

## Project Overview
This project is a digital thermometer that measures temperature and displays the result on a digital display using the 8051 microcontroller. The system interfaces with a temperature sensor (such as LM35) and converts the analog signal to a digital value using an ADC. The temperature value is then shown on a 7-segment display or an LCD.

## Components Used:
- **8051 Microcontroller**: Acts as the central controller of the system.
- **LM35 Temperature Sensor**: Measures the temperature and converts it to an analog voltage.
- **ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)**: Converts the analog voltage from the LM35 to a digital value for processing by the microcontroller (if necessary, depending on your setup).
- **7-Segment Display or LCD**: Displays the temperature value in digital form.
- **Resistors, Capacitors**: For signal conditioning and stability of the system.
- **Power Supply**: Typically 5V to power the 8051 and other components.
- **Breadboard or PCB**: For circuit assembly.

## Features:
- Real-time temperature monitoring.
- Displays temperature on a 7-segment display or LCD.
- Accurate temperature readings with the LM35 sensor.
- Can be used for room temperature measurement or any other application requiring temperature data

## Pin Configuration:
- **8051 Microcontroller Pins**:
  - P0-P3: Used for connecting the data lines of the 7-segment display (if used).
  - P4-P7: For communication with the ADC or sensor.
  - Other control pins as required for interfacing.

- **LM35 Pinout**:
  - Pin 1: VCC (connected to +5V)
  - Pin 2: Output (Analog signal corresponding to temperature)
  - Pin 3: Ground

## How It Works:
1. **Temperature Sensing**: The LM35 temperature sensor outputs an analog voltage corresponding to the temperature. For every 1°C increase in temperature, the LM35 outputs 10 mV.
2. **Analog-to-Digital Conversion**: If the output from the LM35 is analog, an ADC will convert the signal into a digital format for the microcontroller to process. (This step is optional if you’re directly interfacing with the sensor through a microcontroller with ADC built-in).
3. **Processing**: The 8051 microcontroller processes the digital value from the ADC, calculates the temperature, and prepares the data for display.
4. **Display**: The processed temperature data is displayed on a 7-segment display or an LCD.

## Software:
The software for this project is written in Assembly/C for the 8051 microcontroller. It performs the following tasks:
- Reads the temperature data from the sensor.
- Converts the analog value to a digital temperature value.
- Displays the temperature on the connected display.
